Hi, I'm Athwika Gade – a recent Computer Science graduate and aspiring Machine Learning Engineer. I combine a love for problem-solving with technical skills in Python, Flask, and neural networks to create smart, user-friendly solutions. I’ve worked on real-world projects from plant disease detection using CNNs to web-based stock prediction apps. Passionate about both data and development, I’m building a portfolio that bridges machine learning with full-stack tools. Outside of code, I’m always learning, adapting, and curious to explore the world through tech.
